# Design

The layout and logo was made by myself, mainly in PhotoShop. The cats in the
background I got from the Instagram user [@cats_of_insragram](https://instagram.com/cats_of_instagram).

The PSD file is [available here](http://cl.ly/1M3R2j072t0d).

# Tile set

I've used the Instagram API to download a bunch of thumbnails (~37k). The default size of Instagram
thumbnails is 150x150, but for a better performance and mosaic results, I resized all tiles to 15x15.
